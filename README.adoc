I'm a PhD student in sociology at the http://www.essex.ac.uk[University of Essex], my research focus is on politics and crowdfunding. Here I share my writings, fell free to read, comment, criticizeâ€¦

And, yes, I'm geek enough to prefer a markdown language rather than a word processor, GitHub rather than word processors' comments and tracking tools.

As you probably have discovered by yourself, I'm not a native English speaker. I'm really sorry for all the small crimes I commit with your beloved language. I'd be really glad if you point them out.

If this introduction is not enough, you can start to http://cuducos.me[stalk me]. 

== Provisional title and abstract

*Crowdfunding and the possibilities within contemporary political theory: world views and post-politics*

Platforms such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo make initiatives tangible through actions of ordinary people, dismissing institutional support from government or corporations.  Through a social and political analysis of these online gatherings, my ongoing PhD research calls into question the spaces where people pursue public and private interests. 

The relationship between public and private spheres of action has been long debated in the literature. Arendt criticized the role of modern state as a guardian of individual freedom, highlighting that real possibilities of political action still restricted to political elites. Simultaneously private interests of corporations have compromised the political sphere, argues Wolin and Schedler. According to them states take decisions within the private realm, diminishing the spaces for public interests. Finally Bellah argued that this scenario and its emphasis in the private interests favored individualism. Yet, he adds, people are not comfortable with it: the lack of social ties makes them eager for connections.

This research is based on interviews I conducted with people engaged with crowdfunding in Brazil, the UK and the USA. I start from the point that if the institutional conjuncture seems to seize the public sphere from people, citizens might be fighting back recreating the public realm within this purportedly private space. Instead of traditional political organizations (such as parties or social movements) crowdfunding benefits from practical disruptions emerged from new technologies. Yet at the same time crowdfunding might grasps what post-representativeness could be or what a post-political pragmatic approach could look like. The discussion considers political possibilities and limitations of this new setting for private and public spaces, Moreover it explores the foundations of this new behaviour through the consolidation of a world view that differs from the one forged by the Weberian protestant ethic, setting new possibilities in terms of social action and social institutions.
